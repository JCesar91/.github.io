					<h4>
					Job Hunting
					</h4>
					<p>Right now my main objective is to get a full-time job in software development. I have been looking online 
					for job opportunities while taking notes of common requirements. Aside from Indeed, I am considering Hired, HackerRank, StackOverflow, and just Googling keywords for 
					job searching.</p>
					
					
					<h4>
					Studying
					</h4>
					<iframe width="600" height="450" class = "center-block"
					src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/UPo-M8bzRrc">
					</iframe>
					<span class="caption text-muted">Someone at Berkeley has uploaded an entire course of Algorithms & Data Structures lead by the awesome Jonathan Shewchuk.</span>
					
					<p>When I am not adding content to this site, I'm more than likely studying elsewhere or coding. I am also looking at 
					job postings, mostly on Indeed.com. While applying to jobs, I like to look at the requirements and qualifications so that I can be better prepared. I see 
					object-oriented programming A LOT. So I am going over Java a lot. I think that If I keep practicing Java, the more I know, the more I will be able to transfer my skill and understanding to another 
					language when necessary. I'd rather focus on Java right now to grasp all basic OOP concepts, then I will apply what I know to other languages. I've used C# in class before and it was very similar to Java. It 
					was so similar that I was able to Google everything I needed to construct a basic MVC-themed website. It was like knowing English, and 'googling' how to say a certain sentence in French. There are some other 
					differences however such as the inability to declare fields in a C# interface which are learned through practice. 
					</p>
					
					<p>
					What I have identified that I need are the following:
					<ul>
						  <li>The best understanding of at least one OOP language that I can comprehend(I see Java a lot).</li>
						  <li>Experience & knowledge with databases, SQL/MySQL/SQL Server.</li>
						  <li>Experience & knowledge of Javascript/React/Angular.</li>
						  <li>Experience & knowledge of HTML/CSS.</li>
						  <li>Scripting experience(Windows/Bash Shell).</li>
						  <li>Ability and desire to work well with others.</li>
						  <li>Strong verbal and written communication.</li>
						</ul>
					I am comfortable with Java, I will probably go over some interview algorithms(HackerRank), some Data Structures, and terminology. Databases do not worry me to much, SQL commands are straight-forward but can get a little confusing when they get specific. 
					I have a little bit of experience with JavaScript, but it does not hurt to practice it more. I am also comfortable with HTML and CSS. Scripting I have done only using Ubuntu and GitHub. I am going to look into this more. The rest is all behavioral and I am confident that I am 
					able of working well with others and communicating well based on feedback, and it is something that I enjoy.
					</p>
					
					<h4>
					Creating New & Enhancing Projects
					</h4>
					
					<p>
					Right now, I want to create some sort of application that connects to the internet that uses JSON to retrieve and parse data. In school I was assigned to construct an RSS reader 
					but I was not too happy with how it came out. I spent a lot of time on it but maybe I could do a better job now. The process of discussing with classmates and the professor was very fun 
					however. I might also create a weather app but I do not know in what platform. I could combine it with my alarm clock in Android, but we'll see. I could also create another site in C# using the MVC theme that uses a SQL database. I've done something similar in PHP and C#, 
					but it was very basic despite me learning a lot from it. I am still contemplating on what to do after finishing with this site.
